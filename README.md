# Bird Counter

This is a little fun project, aimed to help me count birds I see on my walk. Originally it was a [team exercise](https://github.com/E-K8/w8d2_react-practice_creativity-challenge-maria-nicolas-kate) during a React week in [School of Code](https://www.schoolofcode.co.uk/). I later reworked it to fix bugs and add to functionality.
